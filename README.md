Heart Failure Outcome Prediction
Overview
The Heart Failure Outcome Prediction project leverages machine learning to predict the risk of heart failure outcomes in patients using clinical data. It combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to offer actionable insights for healthcare professionals.

The primary goal of this project is to assist in the early detection of high-risk patients, empowering clinicians to make informed decisions and improve patient care. To enhance usability, the project has been developed into an interactive web application using Streamlit, providing users with an intuitive platform to explore data, visualize trends, and generate predictions in real-time.
